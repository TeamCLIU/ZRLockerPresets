# ZR Locker Presets Loader

### Functions
* Create presets to save your combos for later
* Emotes and sprays support
* Ability to leave slots unchanger
* Load with just a file name

### Usage
* Make sure you have a folder called **"presets"** in the same directory as the scripts.
* Run **new.py** to generate a new preset in the **presets** folder.
* Change up the values in the newly created json file to skin IDs of whatever skin you'd like.
* If you don't want to go through the process of finding the IDs, you can save your current in-game locker using **save.py**.
* Run **loader.py** and type the name of your preset file (ex. `preset.json` or `preset`, both will work). That's it.

### Q&A
**Q: Will this work for skins I don't own?**<br>
A: No, these scripts will only work if you have the skin you put in the preset file.

**Q: How do I get skin IDs?**<br>
A: The [Skin ID Finder](https://github.com/TeamCLIU/ZRSkinIDFinder "ZRSkinIDFinder") repository might be useful! Use it to get IDs just by knowing the skin's name.

**Q: Can I get banned for using this?**<br>
A: I'm almost sure you can't but use this at your own risk.

**Q: I don't see the skins I put in the preset as equipped in my locker, did it work?**<br>
A: Yes, it did. Your skins are going to be visible in game and after some time or restarting the game the locker should update as well.
